# classifyingBridges
A model that will identify which pitsburgh bridges are likely to fail.

Dataset: The input consists of a data set which characterizes 108 Pittsburgh bridges

In this project, I have built 2 models for classifying bridges: one using neural network and other using DecisionTree Algorithm.

Implemented neural network model using Matlab.
